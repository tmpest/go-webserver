          "A lot has happened since our last update! Construction has proceeded at lightning fast paced, considering Covid-19 is still going on in full swing it's crazy to think things look like the house will still be ready sometime in October. It's even crazier to think our original guess may actually be right, things are pointing to sometime in October for a close date. There is still a lot of unknowns, and in our last update we were told there are labor shortages for some of the hard surface installations we had coming up, so we could still be wrong.",
          "The builders have finished framing, rough in, insulation, and drywall. When all the plumbing and electrical was completed we did a walk through with the build manager as he did his inspection. We found a few missing things but they were fixed a day or two later, but it was great to be able to go over it with them.",
          "Up next should be all the interior work. Flooring, cabinets, counters, painting, and more. We should get our official close date in the next couple of weeks, and with that probably another update with some photos! Until then, enjoy some photos of some of work done since our last update."

We think for our first try at it, our house should look pretty nice.",

There will be a tile backsplash behind the stove. Theres a lot more but I think those were some of our favorites, the rest you will just have to come and see!",

          "Olivia and myself had been dreaming about a house for a while, and when 2020 rolled around we resolved ourselves to buy a house. Initially we had been looking exclusively within Seattle and had found a lot of properties we liked in the West Seattle area and some in nearby South Seattle neighborhoods.",
          "We learned a lot! Especially about what we really cared about and we both preferred newer construction to a project home. A lot of older properties still sell for (in my opinion) absurdly high prices in Seattle, it was very hard to rationalize the costs of a house that still required a lot money and time when newer homes were selling at the similar prices.",
          "On February 8th 2020, we saw a community North of Seattle called <a href=\"https://www.pulte.com/homes/washington/seattle/lynnwood/hall-lake-210342\">Hall Lake built by Pulte Homes</a>. The homes were beautiful and we saw something that made us pause awant to stop looking. Although... the first time we went looking for it, we got lost and couldn't find it &#x1F606;"
