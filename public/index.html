    <p>I plan to continue to develop this site to share a lot the things both Olivia and myself get up to. Like how I built this website and other technical projects, cooking projects that either of us could be involved in, video games, and there will even be a special section just for Olivia to share her news.</p>

<div class="container px-5 py-1">
    <p>Stayed tuned! There's a lot more to come!</p>
